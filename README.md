# supervised_and_unsupervised_learning
-Hi!

-At the top of the preprocessing.py file there is a variable called "test", this variable is used to check if everything works(it takes a small amount of data), by default this value set to 0 i.e use all (or percentage) of the data, if you want to test the methods on a smaller scale, you can change this value to 1

-To run this projecct simply extract the csv file and put all the files in the same directory, run main.py for the methods and graphs.py for the graphs
