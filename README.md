# supervised_and_unsupervised_learning
Hi!
at the top of the preprocessing.py file there is a variable called "test", this variable is used to check if everything works(it takes a small amount of data), by default this value set to 0 i.e use all (or percentage) of the data, if you want to test the methods on a smaller scale, you can change this value to 1
